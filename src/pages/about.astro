                    Since beginning my journey as a designer 10 years ago, I have developed a strong 
                    understanding for how humans interact with digital products.

                    I work with SaaS companies launching new products or redesigning legacy products,
                    to design timeless and intuitive software by simplifying complex workflows.
                    This impact may look like faster form completions, meeting regulatory 
                    standards, or increasing product adoption rates.
                </h2>
                <h2>
                    My design process focuses on uncovering the root causes of customer challenges to create 
                    design solutions by applying a research-based design approach.
                </h2>

                    This is what I believe is necessary for creating both intuitive and timeless products.
