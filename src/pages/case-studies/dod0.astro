			The U.S. Department of Defense is America's largest government
			agency which provides the military forces needed to deter war and to
			protect the security of the United States. Our team at Crowdbotics
			worked on the

			<h2>Problem</h2>
			<p>
				Air Force pilots conduct post-flight debriefing sessions to
				assess their performance and mistakes, but analog tools such as
				whiteboards and writing notes hinders their ability to
				effectively learn from missions by relying on memory.

			<h2>Business goals</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Utilize avionics data collected on military aircraft</li>
				<li>
					Leverage AI for the identifying and grading of aerial
					maneuvers
				</li>
				<li>
					Plan for missions based on squadron or pilot proficiency
				</li>

			<h1>Research</h1>
			<h2>User interviews</h2>
			<p>
				I conducted interviews with 4 pilots stationed at Seymour
				Johnson Air Force Base to understand their work habits, pain
				points, and expectations of flight debriefing in a digital
				workspace. The pilots are familiar with their jargon and onboard
				flight instruments so they didn’t want to relearn how to do
				simple things. Pilots wanted to know at a glance what maneuvers
				were flown and how well they performed each one.
			</p>

			<blockquote>
				Typically at the end of the debrief the student keeps some
				notes, but we erase our tapes. We erase our shot sheets and all
				the data gets flushed.
			</blockquote>
		</div>

		<div class='text-width'>
			<h2>User flow</h2>
			<p>
				The primary flow we considered is uploading the acquired flight
				data, viewing the maneuver analysis, and adding comments about
				the sortie.

			<h2>Usability testing</h2>
			<p>
				Releases were pushed at the end of every two-week sprint which
				gave us time to incrementally make changes and gather feedback
				from pilots such as:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Renaming labels to be more familiar with Air Force pilots
					and instructors
				</li>
				<li>
					Organizing large sums of data to be more easily scannable
				</li>
				<li>
					Inclusive design patterns to accommodate for users mental
					models
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</Content>
	<Content>
		<div class='text-width'>
			<blockquote>
				It allows them to get an objective view of what is happening and
				how they flew and be able to make incremental, sometimes
				significant changes to how they're flying to be safer, more
				effective or more lethal

			<h2>Technical limitations</h2>
			<p>
				While striving towards an ideal user experience, our team
				encountered a number of challenges throughout the development
				process:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Our team used Google’s Material design library to jumpstart
					the implementation of our design system in Figma
				</li>
				<li>
					Some design components were made to suit our specific use
					case that are not a part of publicly accessible open-source
					design libraries
				</li>
				<li>
					Our team used CesiumJS to visualize the geospatial data in
					an interactive and 3-dimensional space
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Maneuvers</h2>
			<p>
				Detected maneuvers are classed by a passing, acceptable, or
				failed grading scale. Maneuvers that can’t be identified with
				certainty are considered possible detections. Selecting a
				maneuver jumps to that timestamp in the viewer to be replayed.

			<h2>Analysis</h2>
			<p>
				Pilots can replay their recently flown sorties allowing them to
				pause, rewind, speed up, or jump to any maneuver on the
				timeline. The viewport enhances the pilot's ability to
				objectively break down their flight by simulating the flight as
				it happened, not as they remember it happening.

			<h2>Pilot profile</h2>
			<p>
				Every pilot is placed into a percentile within their squadron
				based on the flight performance of their aircraft over a period
				of time. These grades can then be collected by pilot instructors
				to more accuractely assess the mission readiness of pilots.
