			<h2>The Challenge</h2>
			<p>
				The U.S. Department of Defense faced a critical issue: how to accurately assess mission readiness of pilots.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Current approach:</b> Post-flight debriefs that heavily rely on instructor feedback
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Missed opportunity:</b> Each aircraft generates millions of data points during flight, but this data wasn’t 
					being fully leveraged to evaluate and track performance.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				To address this the 333rd Fighter Squadron at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base partnered with Crowdbotics. 
				I joined a cross-functional team of developers, data scientists, and project managers to redesign the Data 
				Driven Readiness (DDR) software. Our mission was to enhance how pilots analyze maneuvers and seamlessly integrate 
				flight data into their daily workflow.

			<h2>Research Kick-off</h2>
			<p>
				To understand the problem we conducted usability tests of the current DDR software with five pilots.
			</p>
			<p>
				Pain points we uncovered:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>Unclear grades</b> -> Ambiguous scoring made it hard for pilots to know how well they performed
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Awkward controls</b> -> Limited descriptions made it difficult to view maneuvers from the right angles
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Inaccurate timestamps</b> -> Maneuvers on the timeline didn’t match actual flight events, requiring tedious scrubbing
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Isolated notes</b> -> Missing collaboration features made notes only useful as personal reminders
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Key Insights</h2>
			<p>
				Pilots valued DDR’s potential but needed usability improvements before they could fully rely on it. 
				Our research revealed four design priorities:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<b>Transparent grading system:</b> Define a clear criteria with detailed explanations and visual indicators
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Intuitive camera controls:</b> Simplify the interactions and guide users
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Accurate timestamps:</b> Automatic alignment with actual maneuvers
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Collaborative notes:</b> Ability to tag team members, add context, and foster discussion
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Mapping mouse and keyboard controls</h2>
			<p>
				The DDR viewport simulates the aircraft and maneuvers in the browser. Through our user testing it was revealed that:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Default mouse controls were restrictive and disorienting
				</li>
				<li>
					No keyboard shortcuts were available
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				I reassigned the mapping of keyboard and mouse controls to:
			</p>
			<ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
				<li>
					Simplify the controls for better accessibility
				</li>
				<li>
					Added keyboard shortcuts to quickly navigate the timeline
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Reducing cognitive load</h2>
			<p>
				We reorganized DDR’s core layout into clear, repeatable sections:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<b>Header</b> -> Global navigation and system actions
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Side panel</b> -> Supporting details
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Viewport</b> -> Maneuver visualization
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Timeline</b> -> Performance metrics
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				This consistency reduced cognitive load and improved predictability across the platform.

			<h2>Clarity to Maneuver Grades</h2>
			<p>
				Instead of vague sliding scales, we introduced parameter-level pass/fail grades. 
				This helped pilots pinpoint areas for improvement without ambiguity.

			<h2>Collaborative Notetaking</h2>
			<p>Pilots can now tag teammates, trigger email notifications with mentions, and timestamp notes to reference exact moments 
			in the timeline. These features increase the collaboration between pilots and instructors.</p>

			<p class='p2 mono'>Design solution #3</p>
			<h2>Real-Time Performance Visualization</h2>
			<p>We layered user-generated and AI-driven notes directly onto the timeline reel. Pilots could now:</p>
			<ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
				<li>
					View note indicators directly on the timeline
				</li>
				<li>
					Access to layered real-time aircraft performance data
				</li>
				<li>
					Cross-check AI evaluations using human judgment
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Impact</h2>
			<p>
				We transformed DDR from being difficult to use into a collaborative tool that pilots trust to evaluate and improve their 
				performance, while still fitting into their demanding workflows. The improvements that made the biggest impact for pilots were:
			</p>
			<ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
				<li>
					Quickly identify performance gaps through transparent grading
				</li>
				<li>
					Navigate flight simulations more efficiently with intuitive controls
				</li>
				<li>
					Collaborate with instructors with interactive notes
				</li>
				<li>
					Cross-evaluations with human analysis from the enhanced visualizations
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
			<p>This project was as much about adapting design methods to constraints as it was about building a better tool:</p>
			<ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
				<li>
					<b>Adapt to user constraints</b> -> Pilots limited availability required leaner, flexible research methods
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Embrace the learning curve</b> -> The aviation industry is highly technical. Building domain knowledge gave me 
					confidence to drive design decisions
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Organize research better</b> -> A dedicated repository would have made user research insights easier to share with stakeholders
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Bridge design and development</b> -> By learning GitHub workflows and contributing to CSS tokens, I accelerated implementation and improved 
					team collaboration
				</li>
			</ul>
